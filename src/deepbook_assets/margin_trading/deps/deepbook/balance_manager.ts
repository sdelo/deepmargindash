/**
 * The BalanceManager is a shared object that holds all of the balances for
 * different assets. A combination of `BalanceManager` and `TradeProof` are passed
 * into a pool to perform trades. A `TradeProof` can be generated in two ways: by
 * the owner directly, or by any `TradeCap` owner. The owner can generate a
 * `TradeProof` without the risk of equivocation. The `TradeCap` owner, due to it
 * being an owned object, risks equivocation when generating a `TradeProof`.
 * Generally, a high frequency trading engine will trade as the default owner.
